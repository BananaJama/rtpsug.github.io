In today's world of connected computers, using PowerShell is not limited to managing only your computer or the others on your network. It is possible to manage computers across the globe and consume information from the internet all from your PowerShell cmd prompt.

This month Jonathan Moss will be showing how you can use APIs to retrieve data and make changes to a computer that could be next door or half way across the world!

Jonathan Moss [@jwmoss](https://twitter.com/jwmoss) is a senior system engineer for a financial company in the Raleigh Area. His daily activities require him to interact with various systems on his network, in the cloud and across the internet. One of the ways he does this is through the use of APIs.

Jonathan will demonstrate the basics of working with APIs, give you some tips and tricks on how to work efficiently and finish up with a demo of how he was able to access the data on a Tesla Model S electric car with PowerShell all through the APIs provided with the car!
