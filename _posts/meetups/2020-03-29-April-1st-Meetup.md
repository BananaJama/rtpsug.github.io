Join us as we lighten things up with April Fools Day fun and PowerShell tips and tricks!

<!--more-->

Our speaker for this session is Steven Judd [@stevenjudd](https://twitter.com/stevenjudd), who is a Digital Security Analyst at Devon Energy Corporation. Steven's day to day focus is on DevOps and cloud focused solutions and infrastructure. Steven has amassed a bunch of fun and unusual tips and tricks over the years and he'll be sharing them with you!

Each tip or trick will be followed with an explanation for what can be learned from what may seem like a silly example to show that even when you are playing around and having some fun you can still learn some solid fundamentals for writing PowerShell scripts.

The entire session will be a series of quick “lightning” type demos of PowerShell tricks that “struck” Steven as funny. He will “ground” these examples with best practices and PowerShell fundamentals. So laugh, groan, boo, and whatever else as he “electron”-ically demonstrates that PowerShell can be fun as well as functional.

Also, Steven guarantees that there will be original, never before heard Dad jokes between each example. It will be a session packed with some serious silliness. Come learn some dirty deeds done dirt cheap with PowerShell.
