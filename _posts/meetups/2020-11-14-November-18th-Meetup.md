PowerShell has surpassed the administrative use that it was originally developed for and now additionally serves as a capability that enables threat hunters and incident responders to illuminate malicious activity and respond to such threats.

It also enables pentesters and malicious actors to gain and maintain access as well as proliferate throughout a network without bringing any additional toolkits. In most cases, the two additional uses often are not detected or known by the admins or the opposite side. We will dive into and demo a number of methods in which both sides are using or could use PowerShell to achieve their overall objectives.

Our speaker, Fernando Tomlinson [@Wired_Pulse](https://twitter.com/Wired_Pulse) is a security expert for the US Army Cyber command handling malware and forensics operations. He is also an adjunct professor teaching Cyber security to our future computer security pros. He also runs the website https://underthewire.tech, which is a wargaming site designed to teach people about PowerShell and cyber security.

Fernando will be walking through the the offensive and defensive tactics that can be employed by users of PowerShell to defend and/or attack a network. Please join us for an eye opening look at the good and bad of PowerShell and how to protect your organization's network.
