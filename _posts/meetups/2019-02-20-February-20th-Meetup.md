## An Introduction to Just Enough Administration

Giving everyone local administrator or domain administrator privileges is a really bad idea. Even the best of admins can make mistakes which can have unexpected consequences.<!--more-->Join James Petty for an introduction to Just Enough Administration and get up to speed on a really powerful method of securing your computing environment.

What is JEA? Just Enough Administration (JEA) is a security technology that enables delegated administration for anything that can be managed with PowerShell. With JEA, you can reduce the number of administrators on your machines by leveraging virtual accounts or group managed service accounts that perform privileged actions on behalf of regular users. JEA allows you to specify EXACTLY which cmdlets, functions, and external commands a user can or cannot run.

Our speaker, James Petty, is a senior server administrator for the Tennessee Power Authority as well as a leader of the PowerShell.org community forum. James has successfully implemented JEA on a large scale and is well versed in what is involved in getting this powerful technology up and running as efficiently as possible. James has a boatload of practical knowledge on best practices and really smart ideas on how to win over colleagues and managers alike when trying to explain the business case for turning on JEA in your corporate environment.
