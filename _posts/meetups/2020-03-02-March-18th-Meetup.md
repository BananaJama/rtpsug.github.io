Looking to learn how to get started in Azure? Have you considered Serverless apps? Be not afraid. They're easy to build and allow you get started without needing a degree in programming... .

<!--more-->

Our speaker, Jeremy Brown, [@Banana_Jama](https://twitter.com/Banana_Jama) will walk through the basics of serverless apps, build a simple app AND put it online in 45 minutes!

Jeremy is an IT veteran with 20+ yrs in the IT industry. His PowerShell experience goes all the way back to v1 as a Microsoft Trainer. Once he began with PowerShell, he fell in love and has used PowerShell as his primary tool since that time. Jeremy currently works as a sysadmin and cloud ops pro automating Azure and Office 365 in a hybrid environment for the NC Judicial Branch.

Come take a look at the mystery and wonder of using someone else's computer to do your work. We'll explore using Azure Static Websites, REST APIs, and Azure Functions together in a tale of one person’s journey to a “Derpy” webapp of something they could have just Googled.

By the end of our meeting, you will learn how easy and cheap it is to host a website and make that other person’s computer do your bidding.
