Please join us for a very special event!!!! Please be aware that this event will be held on a MONDAY NIGHT!!!

This month we are proud to be hosting Matthais Jessen in person to do a deep dive exploration of the corners of Active Directory Domain Services most admins probably don't think about that often.

Who is Matthias Jessen?
Matthias (twitter: @iisresetme) is a well-known community member who lives in the Netherlands and speaks at just about every major PowerShell conference around the world. He is known for a razor-sharp mind and an interesting wit as well. He works as an AD security engineer and blue team member by day and acts as an advocate for PowerShell and automation in his own personal time.

One thing you can count on with Matthias is to learn something amazing every time he speaks because he is not afraid to explore other areas untouched by many speakers!

Be sure not to miss this event! If you work with Active Directory and its directory service, then this is a must-attend event.

If you cannot join us in person, you can also join us online. This is a live-streamed event that will also be recorded and posted on YouTube afterward. By attending this meeting, you agree to allow us to use any recordings of yourself for later use and to be posted in public forums such as YouTube and Reddit.
