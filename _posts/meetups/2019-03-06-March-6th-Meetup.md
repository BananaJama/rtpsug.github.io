Git is the defacto standard for source control for many years now but it is still a mystery to many admins. Let's change that! Join Thomas Rayner, as he presents his talk on getting started with Git on March 6th at 8:30 pm EST.

Thomas Rayner is an employee of Microsoft, a Pluralsight author, PowerShell community blogger, and source of much information in the PowerShell slack community. He brings his formidable knowledge to help you understand the basics of Git and how you can get started TODAY with source control.
